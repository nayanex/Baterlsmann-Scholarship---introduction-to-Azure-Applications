### Verify Azure Costs

*BE CAREFUL* - When you create your Azure account you will be provided a $200.00 credit with no charge, but this could very easily be used if you’re not careful. **Please use the Standard_B1s size for your VM**, and you should be able to keep the AppService at the free tier with no problem

### Cost Management

You've set up your Azure account in an earlier course; to keep tabs on your Azure cost, and **make sure your costs don’t exceed what’s provided to you in the Azure free tier**, go to Cost Management + Billing, then to Cost Analysis. This shows a cost breakdown of the resources in your subscription. **Be sure to check this each day**, especially if you are using Terraform to create resources. **Also please enable Auto-shutdown for your VM by going to the Azure Portal > your VM > Operations > Auto-shutdown.**
