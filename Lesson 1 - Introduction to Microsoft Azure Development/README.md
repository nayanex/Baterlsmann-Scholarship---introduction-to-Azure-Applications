## Introduction to Cloud Development

[![Introduction To Cloud Development](https://img.youtube.com/vi/MDR-azB162Y/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDR-azB162Y)

The **cloud** is a collection of servers on the internet that store and manage data, run apps, and deliver content such as email or videos. **Cloud computing** is the delivery of software and storage over the Internet (i.e. *the cloud*).

Some of the benefits of using cloud computing are:

* Cost
* Scale
* Reliability
* Security

The three major types of cloud services are **Public**, **Private**, and **Hybrid** cloud. The major differences between these are in where they are deployed, and who manages them. Microsoft OneDrive, Microsoft Azure, and Microsoft Office365 are examples of public cloud options.

Cloud Developers perform some of the following:

* Plan and design cloud based apps
* Monitor, maintain and support cloud applications
* Develop work flows and processes

## Why Cloud Development Is Important

[![Why Cloud Development Is Important](https://img.youtube.com/vi/6Xj7ZVtr9H8/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xj7ZVtr9H8)

You've probably worked with various cloud services before, such as Microsoft OneDrive and Google Docs.

Some of the advantages of cloud computing are:

* Cost: The cloud provider handles all the upfront costs associated with buying hardware, along with on-going maintenance costs
* Scale: Most are pay-as-you-go depending on demand (elasticity), and can be expanded as needed
* Reliability: Management of backups, disaster recovery, etc. is made easier
* Security: Policies and controls are already in place to protect your data

Some of the disadvantages of cloud computing are:

* It is internet-based, so it can be prone to outages and fluctuations in speed
* Sensitive, private and core data is physically located on someone else's server
* Cloud services will be tailored and customized for your specific cloud instance, potentially making it hard to quickly change providers.

### QUIZ 

Which of the following is NOT a reason to develop for the cloud?

[] Lower up-front costs

[] Easier scalability of resources

[] Lower server maintenance costs

[x] No responsibility for security breaches

## Business Stakeholders

[![Business Stakeholders](https://img.youtube.com/vi/uyHY8ECPx2Y/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyHY8ECPx2Y)

As a cloud developer, you will interact and engage with numerous stakeholders, each of whom has different priorities. Some of these are:

* Your users
* Company executives
* I.T. Department
* Cloud Service provider
* Finance Department

### QUIZ

Match each of the below stakeholders to their role in the cloud development process.

* **[IT Department]** Responsible for ensuring individuals have the right access roles based on their positions, and appropriately add or remove access roles when employees join or leave the company

* **[Cloud Developer]** Responsible for ensuring applications run efficiently in the cloud, require appropriate authentication to access, and identifying appropriate resources to use

* **[Company Executives]** Understanding basics of the cloud (including cost/benefits), empowering other departments to take advantage of it, and ensuring staffing needs met in departments making key cloud decisions

* **[Cloud Service Provider]** Ensuring physical cloud infrastructure is kept secure with high uptime

* **[Finance Department]** Work with IT department to ensure critical financial documents are stored in secure environments

## History of Cloud Development

The roots of cloud computing go as far back as the 1960s.

![The timeline of cloud development](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/July/5f10b7b8_cloud-history-timeline/cloud-history-timeline.png)

1969 - JCR Licklider aimed to create a system where information could be accessed anywhere in the world called the “Intergalactic Computer Network”.

1980s - Supercomputing Centers start to form and Commercial Internet Service Providers start to emerge in the late 1980s.

1990 - The internet becomes visible to all when Tim Berners-Lee invents the World Wide Web.

1999 - Salesforce.com launches and becomes a pioneer in delivering enterprise applications over the internet, which is known as Software-as-a-Service(SaaS). This paves the way for other SaaS applications such as Microsoft 365 and Gmail.

2002 - Amazon launches its Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform. AWS is formally launched as a business unit in 2006.

2006 - Amazon launches its Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), a commercial web service that allowed users to rent computers to run their applications. EC2 paved the way for application delivery over the internet, which allowed web-scaled businesses like Netflix and Spotify to exist.

2007 - Dropbox introduces its file hosting service, and with that cloud storage becomes a commodity.

2008 - Google launches its Google App Engine (GAE) Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS). This service allowed developers to host their web applications on Google’s managed data centers.

2010 - Microsoft launches its cloud computing platform, Azure, after announcing it back in 2008. Azure now covers Software-as-a-Service(SaaS), Platform-as-a-Service(PaaS), and Infrastructure-as-a-Service(IaaS).

2011 - IBM launches SmartCloud, a suite of enterprise-class cloud computing technologies for building private, public, and hybrid clouds.

2013 - Google launches Google Compute Engine (GCE) as an addition to its Google Compute Platform. This is an Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) component of the platform that allows a user to spin up Virtual Machines (VMs) on demand.

So what’s next? Cloud computing is on the rise in this day and age. As cloud computing continues to become more mainstream, more and more companies are looking to adopt it. Industries such as marketing, education, and healthcare are beginning to increase their use of cloud-based services and platforms.
